## Project Overview
FPV Car is a Robot Car that will be built to be controlled over kilometers away varying by physical and non-physical (frequency) interference. The FPV Car is build 
that would also be a part of the Virginia Tech Campus. The Car would have about 8-12 channels with functions that would be built, wired, or programmed in. The driving 
of the car would be done through radio that will be modified to run neccessary operations and will be built to run on a frequency level on the lower end. THe video 
transmission for the need of seeing the car through (FPV) will be through a video transmission and recieving system either on the bands between 5.6-6.0ghz or a lower 
band depending on whichever frequency is found to have the best balance between penetration, range, and quality. This car is also something that will/can be used as an on campus known robot that is cabale to interacting with students as well.

## Educational Value Added
THe building of the FPV Car would advance knowledge and experience in the field of working with video and radio frequencies, on the higher (6ghz) and lower (min: 
413mhz) end. Skills such as soldering, wiring, programming, and building would also be worked upon and expanded. The understanding of banding penetration, latency, 
and interference would be built upon. There are also other individual skills that would be learned such as building cooling units/systems, reprogramming car esc, 
motor timing
