# Summary
This is the FPV Car. It is a robot vehicle capable of many actions and the ability to drive very far through built and tuned video and radio ground frequency systems 
channels in the Car allowing to complete actions and do things. Long Video and Radio Frequency systems on robot Cars are not very common especially ones that can interact with students on campus. The whole thing is an advancement of normal Car/vehicle robots being faster, more durable, stronger frequency systems in quality and range.
